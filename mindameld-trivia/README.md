# MindMeld Trivia App
### [MindMeld Trivia App](https://mindameld.surge.sh)

This project is basically, a trivia app, that allows the users to test their general knowledge against the work. To play this game all you need to do is create user name to sign in. This is important as this username will be how the world can see if your a top ten player. Furthermore, a question will be given and, which includes 4 options with one correct answer. It may also contain true or false questions. If the user selects the correct answer he be rewarded with 10 points. In total there are 25 questions in which the user can choose from. The user only has once chance to guess correctly. Once the user completes the quiz and and press sumbit,it is the end of the quiz and the user can playagain. If the user get a top ten score his username will be displayed in the top 10 leaderboard and will be forever rembered util he is beaten, by another user.

## Planning and problem solving
There was problems along the, one of the problems were that the users scores wouldn't register in the top ten straight away from submitting the quiz. They had to relod the page and type in a username to see if the top ten Leaderboard.Furthermore, another problem I was facing was when all the questions where bunched together it only gave the user one option to select from. To solve this problem I used spread oerators to combine al incorrect ansers and corrects answers into a single, which then be randomised so the answers won't be the same box. These where two main problems that I faced during my project.

## Cool tech 
The programming languages I used where REACT, JAVASCRIPT and CSS was also used, to style the page.  

## Bugs to fix 
There are some minor bugs to fix such as the if the user logins and accidently refreshes their page, they will be taken to the dashboard, but the background Images wont be rendered proprely. Another bug is that some the question are also no formated clearly this have symbols, this could be most liklely due to how the API is interpreting data/questins. I would say these are the bugs I would need to addresss first.  

## Lessons learnt
One lesson I have learnt to do is always check for the minor details, such as spelling and the order in which the code is written.

## Future Features
Somethings I would like to add in the future would be to have a background music playing the Background. Likwise also have when user get a question right it will play an uplfiting sound and when they get it wrong a sad sound. Furthermore, I would have liked to add an animations when the player made top ten in the leader board maybe like a message. Furthermore, I would have liked to make sure that the same username couldn't be picked again so it will be more unique to the user. Furthermore, I would like to add a feature so that the users score will depend on how quickly they can finish the quiz. This can stop users from googling the anwers and just ticking the boxes. Or feature where the user only has 7 to 8 seconds to answer the question.
